Over 650 million people depend on climate-sensitive sectors, such as rain-fed agriculture and forestry, for livelihood and over 973 million people are exposed to vector borne malarial parasites. Projection of climatic factors indicates a wider exposure to malaria for the Indian population in the future. If precautionary measures are not taken and development processes are not managed properly some developmental activities, such as hydro-electric dams and irrigation canal systems, may also exacerbate breeding grounds for malaria. This article integrates climate change and developmental variables in articulating a framework for integrated impact assessment and adaptation responses, with malaria incidence in India as a case study. The climate change variables include temperature, rainfall, humidity, extreme events, and other secondary variables. Development variables are income levels, institutional mechanisms to implement preventive measures, infrastructure development that could promote malarial breeding grounds, and other policies. The case study indicates that sustainable development variables may sometimes reduce the adverse impacts on the system due to climate change alone, while it may sometimes also exacerbate these impacts if the development variables are not managed well and therefore they produce a negative impact on the system. The study concludes that well crafted and well managed developmental policies could result in enhanced resilience of communities and systems, and lower health impacts due to climate change.","Garg, A",2018-12-17 18:09:15.258013+00:00,715432,1,1,1,1,3,"Development, Malaria and Adaptation to Climate Change: A Case Study from India",Impact assessment; Development; Climate change; Adaptation; Malaria,['Environmental Sciences']

Extreme consumerism resulting from this orientation often is associated with many personal, social, and environmental problems. Implicated as an agent, among many, in this problematic hyper-economized process is science education. Briefly, our literature reviews suggest that, under influences from apparently hegemonic forces of neoconservatism and neoliberalism, school science often functions to generate knowledge producers, including engineers, scientists and other theoretical workers-who, in turn, may develop and manage mechanisms of production of goods and services on behalf of global economic elite. At the same time, it also is apparent that school science generates a large class of citizens who are prepared, essentially, to serve as consumers-both in terms of faithfully following labor instructions from the aforementioned knowledge producers (who may be accountable mainly to their financiers) and also enthusiastically engaging in repeating cycles of consumption of goods and services. Such a use of education seems undemocratic, at the very least, and highly problematic, assuming an association between school science and many personal, social, and environmental problems. To perhaps bring about a more just and sustainable world, we offer a theoretical framework, along with a more pragmatic version of it, for organizing science and technology education in many contexts. Although based on principles like holism, altruism, realism, egalitarianism, and dualism that we suggest may help school science generate a citizenry willing and able to proactively contribute to the common good, we also urge readers to use it as a basis for further research and development.

Since the 1960s, the traditional extensive cattle ranching has shifted to agriculture with the cultivation of rain-fed rice and, more recently, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Menill]. Introduction of soybean into these areas has depended on selection of cultivars carrying strategic genes determining a few key characteristics, principally late maturity, high aluminium tolerance and calcium-use efficiency. The methods used in developing adapted varieties are reviewed. Identification of the long-juvenile character and selection of genotypes in which this stage is prolonged are identified as keys in the systematic exploitation of plant yield potential. New screening techniques reveal that these savannah-adapted genotypes also carry genes for high-Al and low-Ca tolerances, which allow deep rooting of plants and, consequently, drought tolerance.

The feasibility of using the flooded mine workings as a source of irrigation water was investigated. The geochemistry and stable isotopic composition of water produced during a 59 day pumping test of the flooded Belmont Mine workings are described. Although static water in the pumping well initially met proposed irrigation standards, the quality deteriorated during pumping as water from deeper in the mine complex was drawn into the well. Stable isotopes show that this lower-quality water was not sourced from the nearby Berkeley Pit lake, but most likely came from the mine shaft itself. At steady state, the water pumped to the surface had pH 5.5-6.0 with high concentrations (in mg/L) of dissolved SO(4) (1,600), Fe (160), Mn (19), Zn (15), and As (1.8). Despite substantial bicarbonate alkalinity (approximate to 150 mg/L as CaCO(3)), the water became strongly acidic after equilibration with air due to oxidation and hydrolysis of Fe(2+). Benchtop experiments were performed to test different strategies for low-cost chemical treatment prior to irrigation. The most feasible alternative involved aeration (to remove large quantities of dissolved CO(2)) prior to pH adjustment to >9 with lime or NaOH. Further work is needed to see if such treatment is economically viable compared to the cost of using municipal water. Another concern is whether irrigation of grass with high TDS, high sulfate water is sustainable.

Most work has been performed on interleukin-2 (IL-2). There is considerable evidence from numerous phase II studies that intermittent dosing of subcutaneous IL-2 plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) produces a sustainable rise in the CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count which exceeds that which can be achieved using ART alone, without any adverse effect on plasma HIV RNA. However, the immunological competency and therefore clinical impact of this expanded CD4(+) T cell pool is yet to be established; this question is the focus of two large clinical end-point studies, ESPRIT and SILCAAT. Objective: Prior to the establishment of ESPRIT, four 'Vanguard' studies were undertaken; the UK Vanguard examined the safety and virological/immunological aspects of intermittent subcutaneous IL-2 without the use of ART in HIV-1 ART naive patients with a baseline CD4(+) T cell count of greater than or equal to 350cells/mm(3). Design: The UK Vanguard was an open-label, randomised study comparing subcutaneous (s/c) IL-2 at either 4.5MIU or 7.5MIU q12h for 5 days every 8 weeks versus no therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary endpoints included mean area under the curve change from baseline CD4(+) T cell count and plasma log HIV-RNA. Results: Thirty six subjects were enrolled into the three arms of the UK Vanguard study. Results showed significant differences in the area under the curve (AUC) change from baseline CD4(+) T cell count (P = 0.001) and changes in mean absolute CD4(+) T cell count (P = 0.04) and no significant difference in mean AUC change from baseline plasma HIV-RNA (P = 0.48) at 24 weeks between the IL-2 and control arms respectively. The significance of these results and those from other studies on the use of IL-2 in HIV disease are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Small (1-2 weeks) phenological differences between mid-season ripening cultivars and peak GJB flight translated to marked differences in injury, whereas cultivars that ripened in mid-August or later, after GJB flight had waned, sustained little or no damage. Trapping experiments confirmed that the tougher berries and low sugar content of less-ripe fruit clusters inhibited beetle feeding and induction of yeast-mediated volatiles responsible for GJB host-location.

Overall, where specified, nutrient budgets covered nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in 13 cases, N and P in 12 cases, N only in nine and P only in four cases. The most common indicators for nutrient budgets were calculation of a balance followed by nitrate leached. The method by which indicators were evaluated and presented to farmers varied. Farming sectors were not equally represented with systems for the arable, dairy and pig sectors the most common. Farmers received a detailed interpretation of their results in two thirds of the systems, most commonly related to official limits or targets. Most of the systems were developed to reduce adverse environmental impacts and 65% of the systems were considered by the respondents to have had a positive environmental impact by reducing surpluses or improving waste disposal. Use of five of the systems could lead to a marketing advantage via certified produce with a recognised quality label. Where factual evidence as to effectiveness was available, the benefits varied between subject types (nutrients, energy and pesticides) and between sectors. Farmers' responses to the systems were generally positive and they appear to be a useful way of raising awareness of environmental problems. However, economic issues need to be considered, if the costs to the farmer outweigh the benefits, uptake will not be sustained.

It is found that while an equity holding can provide significant returns to a local community, it also exposes them to significant financial risk.

For exogenous discount factors, self-governance management regimes do better than command-and-control in terms of the long-term sustainability of the fish resources, if the fisher's discount factor is higher than that of the regulator, and vice versa if the discount factor of the regulator is higher. Under the assumption of endogenous discount factors, the decision whether to promote a command-and-control management system or a self-governance or co-management structure will depend on: (i) the magnitude of the intertemporal preferences of both the fishers and the regulator; and (ii) the relative weight or political influence of the fishers on the regulators' decision-making process. Hence, this contribution highlights the possibility that command-and-control can be less sustainable than self-governance and vice versa. It is therefore important to explicitly take account of intertemporal preferences in the decision-making process if a governance system for a given fishery is to succeed. For many fisheries, it is difficult to know the 'true' discount factors of both fishers and governments, hence, the practical message from this paper is that to guide against over exploitation of fishery resources, it is prudent to put in place co-management arrangements, since both discount factors, whatever they may be, will be weighted into the decision-making process.","Sumaila, UR",2018-12-17 18:09:46.421485+00:00,729987,1,1,1,1,3,Discount factors and the performance of alternative fisheries governance systems,Co-management; conventional and intergenerational discounting; command-and-control; self-governance,['Fisheries']
21,WOS:000348032400013,"Mihalache, C, Buscarnera, G","This paper provides an interpretation of the phenomenon of wetting collapse in fine-grained soils based on principles of material stability. For this purpose, classic experiments displaying the accumulation of irreversible compaction have been reinterpreted through a plasticity model for unsaturated soils. The resulting simulations have been inspected mathematically, with the goal of detecting a possible loss of control of the wetting process. The reanalysis of the experiments suggests that, if the wetting-induced deformations are interpreted as homogeneous, the considered compaction events do not tend to be affected by a loss of material stability. As a result, such well-known phenomena have been explained as controllable modes of plastic deformation. This feature has been found to be valid regardless of the mode of saturation (i.e., it is valid for both controlled suction removal and water volume injection). Indeed, parametric analyses have shown that the compaction process tends to become unstable only in the presence of highly water-sensitive media exposed to a drastic loss of suction (e. g., soaking or injection), i.e., circumstances during which the soil undergoes large strains and suffers a marked deterioration of its mechanical properties. In these cases, the theory predicts a limit threshold of the water content at which the control of the injection process is lost, the applied stress is no longer sustainable, and even infinitesimal alterations of the moisture content can cause a sharp accumulation of compaction. These findings impact the interpretation of wetting-induced settlements predicted via computational models, and are of general relevance for the design, maintenance, and safety assessment of unsaturated earthen systems interacting with hydrologic processes.

Plastic waste collection is featured with various alternatives of collection methods (curbside/drop-off) and separation methods (source-/post-separation). In the Netherlands, the collection routes of plastic waste are the same as those of other waste, although plastic is different than other waste in terms of volume to weight ratio. This paper aims for redesigning the collection routes and compares the collection options of plastic waste using eco-efficiency as performance indicator. Eco-efficiency concerns the trade-off between environmental impacts, social issues and costs. The collection problem is modeled as a vehicle routing problem. A tabu search heuristic is used to improve the routes. Collection alternatives are compared by a scenario study approach. Real distances between locations are calculated with MapPoint. The scenario study is conducted based on real case data of the Dutch municipality Wageningen. Scenarios are designed according to the collection alternatives with different assumptions in collection method, vehicle type, collection frequency and collection points, etc. Results show that the current collection routes can be improved in terms of eco-efficiency performance by using our method. The source-separation drop-off collection scenario has the best performance for plastic collection assuming householders take the waste to the drop-off points in a sustainable manner. The model also shows to be an efficient decision support tool to investigate the impacts of future changes such as alternative vehicle type and different response rates.

The efficiency of different hatching media and effectiveness of long term storage methods are presented here. Methods: The effect on hatch rate of storage duration and three hatching media was analysed: deionized water, boiled deionized water and a bacterial broth, using Two-way ANOVA and Post hoc Tukey tests, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to find the effect on the proportion of collapsed eggs. Two long term storage methods were also tested: conventional storage (egg paper strips stored in zip lock bags within a sealed plastic box), and water storage (egg papers in a covered plastic cup with deionized water). Regression analyses were used to find the effect of water storage and storage duration on hatch rate. Results: Both species hatched most efficiently in bacterial broth. Few eggs hatched in deionized water, and pre-boiling the water increased the hatch rate of Ae. aegypti, but not Ae. albopictus. A hatch rate greater than 80 % was obtained after 10 weeks of conventional storage in Ae. aegypti and 11 weeks in Ae. albopictus. After this period, hatching decreased dramatically; no eggs hatched after 24 weeks. Storing eggs in water produced an 85 % hatch rate after 5 months in both species. A small but significant proportion of eggs hatched in the water, probably due to combined effects of natural deoxygenation of the water over time and the natural instalment hatching typical of the species. Conclusions: The demonstrated efficiency of the bacterial broth hatching medium for both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti facilitates mass production of these two important vector species in the same facility, with use of a common hatching medium reducing cost and operational complexity. Similarly the increased hatch rate of eggs stored in water would allow greater flexibility of egg management in a large programme over the medium term, particularly if oxygenation of the water by bubbling oxygen through the storage tray could be applied to prevent hatching during storage.","Zheng, ML",2018-12-17 18:07:25.197492+00:00,701413,2,2,2,2,3,Standard operating procedures for standardized mass rearing of the dengue and chikungunya vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) - II - Egg storage and hatching,Bacterial broth; Boiled water; Hatch rate; Egg storage; Mass rearing; Mosquito production; Aedes; Dengue; Chikungunya,['Parasitology']

The patterned structures were fabricated using breath figures as dynamic templates in which polar block enriches at the rim of the pores. This characteristic of the breath figure method makes it possible to employ a simple coating technique to construct substrates decorated with Ag NPs, which have a diameter mostly ranging from 18 to 30 nm. Results indicate that the hierarchically ordered substrates show enhancement factors as high as 4 X 10(8). It is also found that the enhancement factors are concentration-dependent, relying on the ratio of the number of analytes to Ag NPs. Moreover, the prominent enhancement at Raman shift of similar to 614 cm(-1) has been observed, which will be useful in the detection of analytes such as some kinds of pesticides and viruses with characteristic peaks in this Raman shift range (e.g., adenovirus).

Developing a framework around the concept of friction (material resistance or recalcitrance encountered in processes of transformation), we analyze an Energy Self-sufficient Village program in Indonesia. Focusing on specific projects and episodes within this program, we identify multiple distinctive instances of friction. These were driven by nonhumans' (and humans') resistance, as remolding of development beneficiaries' practices was attempted by project administrators, government officials, entrepreneurs and by the (scientific) calculations embedded in their policies, strategies and models. In concluding, we distill four ways in which nonhumans relationally shape development practices: (a) by resisting representations and calculations produced by human actors, (b) by re-directing planned/expected courses of action, (c) through biophysical change to their weight or textures as they move in space and time, and (d) by mediating competition for resources. Overall, nonhumans play a central role in making and unmaking asymmetric relations of power in practice and by constituting practices that diverge from prior expectations, problematize linear understandings of 'policy implementation'. Their material and discursive agency is multiple, manifesting differently in different relational settings, which highlights the importance of broadening the range of spokespersons who speak on behalf of nonhumans and whose voices can be considered reliable and true.

Observations have shown that internal cavities caused by termites in tree stems often result in external hollows under annual fire regimes, and it is quite possible that such hollows/fire interaction may increase the probability of trunk or big branch breakage and/or tree mortality. A study of individual tree and branch mortality as a function of prior termite and fire damage was undertaken in a West African savanna (Lamto, Cte d'Ivoire) where most of the trees naturally have hollows in their stems due to termite and fire interaction. Our goal was to examine the dynamics of hollowing and to determine whether hollowing significantly affected tree mortality. Branch and whole plant mortality were quantified for dominant tree species according to their initial hollow state and height. Four different responses were obtained depending on tree species: (1) mortality increased with cavity severity and tree size (Piliostigma thonningii), (2) mortality depended on tree size only (Bridelia ferruginea), (3) no mortality even after being hollowed by termites and externally damaged by fire (Crossopteryx febrifuga, the species with the highest proportion of individuals with hollows yet the greatest background survival time, 14 +/- A 2 years) and (4) high mortality, but few hollow trees suggesting a weak resistance to hollowing (Cussonia arborea which was insensitive to all the factors examined in this study). For species resistant to hollowing, tree mortality was rare; alternatively, for species prone to hollowing, whole trees died quickly and before the most severe hollow classes could be observed. Long-term demographic data yielded population-level mortality estimates of adult trees at least four times lower in fire-exclusion zones than that in fire-prone areas.

We then use a two-stage environmental network DEA model to compare their efficiency performance. Analysis of the evaluation results leads to the following conclusions. Generation forms have a significant influence on the environmental efficiency performance of power systems, but the differences vary greatly according to the power supply and demand situation. The policy to incentivize clean energy development has achieved its objective in the generation division and further policy reforms should be extended to the grid division. A more flexible power development plan should be implemented according to regional resources endowment for better planning of power system development on a nationwide basis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasingly, developed nations are adopting explicit legislation and policy governing the assessment and management of their fisheries against criteria of ecological sustainability. Yet the ability to evaluate ecosystem impacts of fisheries is compromised by a general lack of understanding of marine ecosystem function (beyond the population level) and a lack of robust and practical indicators for ecosystem health and management. Recent technological advances can assist in developing criteria, including structural analyses of seafloor communities potentially impacted by fishing gears (e.g. demersal trawling). Similarly, advances in fishing gear technology, including improved selectivity and the development of gears which have a more benign environmental impact, can mitigate some of the ecological impacts of fishing.

The model allows for the determination of microalgae and hydrogen mass fractions produced by the photobioreactor with respect to time. A Michaelis-Menten type expression is proposed for modeling the rate of hydrogen production, which introduces a mathematical expression to calculate the resulting effect on H-2 production rate after genetically modifying the microalgae species. The so called indirect biophotolysis process was used. Therefore, a singular opportunity was identified to optimize the aerobic (t(1)), to anaerobic (t(2)), stages time ratio of the cycle for maximum H-2 production rate, i.e., the process rhythm. A system thermodynamic optimization is conducted through the complete model equations to find accurately the optimal system operating rhythm for maximum hydrogen production rate, and how wild and genetically modified species compare to each other. The maxima found are sharp, showing up to a similar to 60% variation in hydrogen production rate for t(2,opt) +/- 1 day, which highlights the importance of system operation in optimal rhythm. Therefore, the model is expected to be useful for design, control and optimization of hydrogen production as a source of renewable energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although trade-offs between each of these variables are important, this paper emphasizes the social components of resource management. In this regard a distinction is made between individual and cooperative choices. Individual choices frequently are made from a short-term, self-interested perspective, whereas cooperative choices are made from a long-term, community and resource-sustainability perspective. Typically, when presented with a spectrum of resource management decisions, individuals have a tendency to act in a self-interested manner. Thus, cooperative benefits, such as reduced conflict and improved resource certainty, are not realized. An overview of selected aspects of social dilemma theory suggests that socially cooperative choice outcomes are attainable in coastal zone management by integrating structural and behavioral solutions in resource use decision making. Three barriers to successful integration of structural and behavioral solutions are identified as self-interest, mistrust, and variable perceptions of resource amenities. Examples from coastal zone management indicate that these barriers may be overcome using approaches such as scope-reduction, co-management, community education, and local participation.

Odum envisioned a sustainable approach to systems design where human intervention would be supplementary to nature. He referred to this concept as ecological engineering and suggested that practitioners should receive an education beyond the rigors of engineering. To understand natural processes needed to design, develop, and restore natural systems successfully, Odum suggested ecological engineers should have an expanded knowledge of environmental systems and ecology. Furthermore, he recommended broadening educational exposure to social science and liberal arts. The field of ecological engineering has blossomed in the years since Odum expressed his vision, but universities have not adopted his suggested curriculum, and undergraduate engineering students have generally seen a reduction in social science and liberal arts courses. This paper compares Odum's vision with the surveyed visions of an international group of ecological engineers, who assessed the value and characteristics of an ecological engineering undergraduate education.

Factor analysis of the survey data resulted in four categories of outcomes (environmental, economic, social and operational). The study found that environmental purchasing has a positive effect on three categories of outcomes (economic, social and operational), whereas sustainable packaging has a positive effect on environmental, economic and social outcomes. The results have empirically proven that SSCM practices have a positive effect on sustainable supply chain performance, particularly from the economic and social perspective.

Relationships between travel mode and emotions, parent perceptions of their child's travel mode on well-being, and factors related to parent perceptions were examined. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to families (N=5423) from 76 elementary schools. Explanatory variables were demographics (age and sex), school travel measures (mode, distance, accompaniment by an adult, safety, and barriers), and emotions (parent and child). Outcomes examined parent perceived benefits of travel mode on dimensions of well-being (physical, emotional, community, and environmental). Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and hierarchical regression were used. RESULTS: Parents and children who used AST reported more positive emotions versus passive travelers. Parents of active travelers reported stronger connections to dimensions of well-being. AST had the strongest association with parents' perceptions of their child's well-being, and positive emotions (parent and child) were also significantly related to well-being on the trip to school.

However, this type of therapy is cumbersome and associated with several side-effects. We investigated the feasibility of using a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) agonist for obtaining drug-induced sustainable mild hypothermia. Methods: First, we screened a heterogeneous group of TRPV1 agonists and secondly we tested the hypothermic properties of a selected candidate by dose-response studies. Finally we tested the hypothermic properties in a large animal. The screening was in conscious rats, the dose-response experiments in conscious rats and in cynomologus monkeys, and the finally we tested the hypothermic properties in conscious young cattle (calves with a body weight as an adult human). The investigated TRPV1 agonists were administered by continuous intravenous infusion. Results: Screening: Dihydrocapsaicin (DHC), a component of chili pepper, displayed a desirable hypothermic profile with regards to the duration, depth and control in conscious rats. Dose-response experiments: In both rats and cynomologus monkeys DHC caused a dose-dependent and immediate decrease in body temperature. Thus in rats, infusion of DHC at doses of 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mg/kg/h caused a maximal Delta T (degrees C) as compared to vehicle control of -0.9, -1.5, -2.0, and -4.2 within approximately 1 hour until the 6 hour infusion was stopped. Finally, in calves the intravenous infusion of DHC was able to maintain mild hypothermia with Delta T > -3 degrees C for more than 12 hours.

This paper aims to analyse the TFC effectiveness. An analysis has been made of the TFCs signed in the Midi-Pyrenees Region in south-western France, using statistical analysis and qualitative surveys of a sample of farms. The results show that the most valuable effects have been mainly economic. Effects regarding social and environmental aspects were very limited. But from the point of view of an integrated approach, indirect effects of TFCs can be observed on social and environmental aspects. These results are explained, on the one hand, by farmers' motivations guided by economic objectives, and on the other hand, by the dominance of professional farming organisations in the implementation of TFC's procedure. Given these results, two ways of improving the elaboration procedure for TFCs are proposed. Firstly, technical improvements can be made to the diagnostic assessment of farms, and to the choice of actions addressed by the contract. Secondly, organisational improvements can be applied to TFCs elaboration and implementation process, in order to adopt a participatory approach which would involve all rural stakeholders.

A wide range of biological and fishery characteristics were used in the model so that our results pertain to the management of virtually any exploited population. Results indicate that two biological reference points based on spawning biomass are insensitive to life-history parameters, whereas one based on natural mortality is highly sensitive. All three depend largely on the choice of a stock-recruitment function and on steepness, a measure of the population growth rate. For each of the three, values have been previously proposed that were intended to safely apply to all fisheries; our results show that no such universal values exist.

Lifespan extension of durable products underpins sustainable consumption. This paper describes a novel approach to extend product lifespans by using product servicing that conceptualizes the interactions of a producer, a policy-maker, and multiple consumer segments having different price-demand relationships. We propose a multi-period mathematical optimization model that maximizes the producer's profit while optimizing the prices of different servicing options, production quantities, and inventory levels. A computational study elicits several insights about how the optimal production (or alternatively) consumption quantities are affected by the introduction of product servicing, and the effects of various product characteristics and government incentive or penalty levels on producer's profitability and on product servicing decisions. We conclude that quantitative optimization models are useful for evaluating the impacts of different regulatory policies, assessing the benefits of offering product servicing options, and investing in design for durability and serviceability.

We used a two-pronged approach, combining a survey with open-ended and psychometric measures with an experimental manipulation, in a U.S., web-based sample (N5428). Only 2% of participants self-identified disgust as important to their decisions about recycled water.

When the maximum allowable withdrawal of groundwater (AWG) is assessed, an ecology-oriented regional groundwater resource assessment (RGRA) method should be used. In this study, a hierarchical assessment index system of the supergene eco-environment was established based on field survey data and analysis of the supergene eco-environment factors influenced by groundwater in the Tuwei River watershed, Shaanxi Province, China. The assessment system comprised 11 indices, including geomorphological type, lithology and structure of the vadose zone, depth of the water table (DWT), total dissolved solids content of groundwater, etc. Weights for all indices were calculated using an analytical hierarchy process. Then, the current eco-environmental conditions were assessed using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE). Under the imposed constraints, and using both the assessment results on the current eco-environment situation and the ecological constraint of DWT (1.5-5.0 m), the maximum AWG (0.408 x 10(8) m(3)/a or 24.29 % of the river base flow) was determined. This was achieved by combining the groundwater resource assessment with the supergene eco-environmental assessment based on FCE. If the maximum AWG is exceeded in a watershed, the eco-environment will gradually deteriorate and produce negative environmental effects.

We provide new evidence on how landscapes change by analysing the spatial patterns of human processes in three forest landscapes in southern Chile at different states of alteration (40%-90% of old-growth forest loss). Three phases of landscape alteration are distinguished. In Phase I (40%-65% of old-growth forest loss), deforestation rates are < 1% yr(-1), forests are increasingly degraded, and clearance for pastureland is concentrated on deeper soils. In Phase 11 (65% -80%), deforestation reaches its maximum rate of 1-1.5% yr(-1), with clearance for pastureland being the main human process, creating a landscape dominated by disturbed forest and shrubland. In this phase, clearance for pastureland is the primary driver of change, with pastures expanding onto poorer soils in more spatially aggregated patterns. In Phase III (80%-90%), deforestation rates are again relatively low (<1% yr(-1)) and forest regrowth is observed on marginal lands. During this phase, clearance is the dominant process and pastureland is the main land cover. As a forest landscape is transformed, the extent and intensity of human processes vary according to the existing state of landscape alteration, resulting in distinctive landscape patterns in each phase. A relationship between spatial patterns of land cover and human-related processes has been identified along the gradient of landscape alteration. This integrative framework can potentially provide insights into the patterns and processes of dynamic landscapes in other areas subjected to intensifying human use. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports a three-year empirical investigation into organisational learning in a large industrial complex, with the aim of clarifying the practices of organisational learning and interpreting them within sociocultural learning theory. A sociocultural model is proposed which identifies dialogue as the fundamental process by which organisations learn, and relational practices as the social structure which embeds the dialogue and makes it sustainable in a potentially conflictual environment. Three relational practices are analysed in detail: opening space for the creation of shared meaning, reconstituting power relationships and providing cultural tools to mediate learning. A pedagogy of organisational learning is defined in terms of participation in these practices, either as the carrier of a practice or as the facilitator of participation by others. The theoretical requirement that adult learning must be autonomous is reconciled with the concept of collective learning in pursuit of organisational goals by rejecting the notion of an individually-contained self in favour of a relational concept of the self, in which autonomy is achieved by building relationships with others.","Boreham, N",2018-12-17 17:43:20.863608+00:00,519376,2,2,2,2,3,A sociocultural analysis of organisational learning,,['Education & Educational Research']

This study is intended to develop a LCSA framework and a case study of LCSA for building construction projects. A LCSA framework is proposed to combine the three life cycle techniques. In the modeling phases, three life cycle models are used in the LCSA framework, namely the environmental model of construction (EMoC), cost model of construction (CMoC), and social-impact model of construction (SMoC). A residential building project is applied to the proposed LCSA framework from ""cradle to the end of construction"" processes to unveil the limitations and future research needs of the LCSA framework. It is found that material extraction and manufacturing account for over 90 % to the environmental impacts while they contribute to 61 % to the construction cost. In terms of social impacts, on-site construction performs better than material extraction and manufacturing, and on-site construction has larger contributions to the positive social impacts. The model outcomes are validated through interviews with local experts in Hong Kong. The result indicates that the performance of the models is generally satisfactory.

Thus, forest managers are never clear about how well their efforts are protecting such plants. We quantified abundance and edge-related variation in 91 species of useful wild plants commonly harvested by communities around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda, to evaluate the effect of their harvest. Forty percent of these species were harvested exclusively for medicines, 22% for weaving, and 24% for other uses. Fourteen percent were harvested for combinations of uses. Plants were surveyed around the entire periphery of the park transects that extended out 1 km into the forest interior from the edge. Analyses of edge and interior distribution were controlled for effects of topography. Individually, nine (10%) species were very rare, occurring in < 0.5% of the plots searched. Of the remaining 82 species, most (50%) decreased significantly away from the park boundary, whereas 4.9% increased and 45.1% showed no pronounced edge-related distributions. Rarer species were no more likely to be less abundant near the edge than commoner species. These results suggest that most plants used for nontimber purposes in BINP are not currently being harvested unsustainably. In this respect many of the species of useful wild plants we examined resembled animals commonly hunted in tropical forests for bushmeat because they increased in abundance in disturbed habitat.

Three experiments were performed to identify factors influencing variability of postthaw sperm survival among 464 boar ejaculates. Sperm-rich ejaculate fractions were cryopreserved using a standard freezing-thawing procedure for 0.5-mL plastic straws and computer-controlled freezing equipment. Postthaw sperm motility (assessed with a computer-assisted semen analysis system) and viability (simultaneously probed by flow cytometry analysis after triple-fluorescent stain), evaluated 30 and 150 min postthaw, were used to estimate the success of cryopreservation. In the first experiment, 168 unselected ejaculates (1 ejaculate/boar), from boars of 6 breeds with a wide age range (8 to 48 mo), were cryopreserved over a 12-mo period to evaluate the predictive value of boar (breed and age), semen collection, transport variables (season of ejaculate collection, interval between collections, and ejaculate temperature exposure), initial semen traits, and sperm quality before freezing on sperm survival after freezing-thawing.

We used a global meta-analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet-wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch-to-quota, current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each, we calculated the mean response, variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region, we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch-to-quota ratios: these ratios were less variable over time than in other fisheries. Over-exploitation occurred in only 9% of stocks under catch shares compared to 13% of stocks under fleet-wide quota caps. Additionally, over-exploitation occurred in 41% of stocks under effort controls, suggesting a substantial benefit of quota caps alone. In contrast, there was no evidence for a response in the biomass of exploited populations because of either fleet-wide quota caps or individual catch shares.

The hydrogeological investigation is based on a multidisciplinary data-layer analysis that includes geomorphology, geology, slope, drainage lines, soil type, structural lineaments, subsurface data, stable isotopes, and chemical analyses. The study area contains Pleistocene and middle Miocene marine limestone aquifers. Based on lithology and microfacies analysis, the middle Miocene aquifer is subdivided into two waterbearing zones. The area is affected by sets of faults and anticline folds, and these structures are associated with fractures and joints that increase permeability and facilitate the recharge of groundwater. Stable isotope data indicate that groundwater of both the Pleistocene and middle Miocene aquifers is recharged by modern precipitation. The high salinity values observed in some groundwater wells that tap both aquifers could be attributed to leaching and dissolution processes of marine salts from the aquifers' marine limestone matrix. In addition, human activities can also contribute to an increase in groundwater salinity. A future water exploration strategy, based on the results from the multidisciplinary data-layer analysis, is proposed for the area.

The water footprint (WF) is a metric that quantifies the potential environmental impact related to water. A number of methods for water footprinting have been proposed, while international standards are in the process of being developed. The water footprints of bottles of wine produced in two different regions of New Zealand were assessed using four water-footprinting methods: the consumptive use method of the Water Footprint Network (WFN), plus two recently proposed life cycle assessment (LCA) based methods and the hydrological water balance method. The outcomes of these methods were evaluated for their ability to indicate the local impacts on water resources and their usefulness to key stakeholders. The WF method of WFN quantifies the blue and green-water consumption, and further information on water resource availability is required to assess the impacts on local water resources. The grey-WF indicates the impact on water quality, and comparisons can be made between products, but the absolute values are less meaningful. The LCA based methods of the stress-weighted WF, freshwater ecosystem impact and freshwater depletion do indicate impacts. Also products from different locations can be compared. However, these indicators are limited in their ability to show local impacts because of constraints in their characterization factors. The WFN method and two LCA methods are based on consumptive water use. The water consumed through evapotranspiration, however, returns as precipitation within a reasonably short time and often at a local scale. So water footprinting based on water consumption alone is limited in terms of assessing the local impact of primary production on water resources. Furthermore, the applicability of the outcomes of these three methods to growers and resource regulators is not straightforward. The hydrological water-balance method indicates the impact on water quantity as a volumetric measure, so that it can be understood by the non-technical community. For the growers, it provides a sensible measure of the impact of their production, as well as useful information for setting measurable targets to reduce the WF. It can also be helpful for resource regulators to manage their water resources by matching water demand to water availability or replenishment. The robustness of the WF protocols for measuring the impact of product life cycle on water quality needs further improvement so that water footprinting can provide metrics of the sustainable use of our water resources.

However, the impact of decline in soil microbial diversity on ecosystem sustainability remains largely unknown. This has been assessed for decomposition, which is insured by a large proportion of the soil microbial community, but not for more specialized and less diverse microbial groups. We determined the impact of a decrease in soil microbial diversity on the stability (i.e. resistance and resilience following disturbance) of two more specialized bacterial functional groups: denitrifiers and nitrite oxidizers. Soil microbial diversity was reduced using serial dilutions of a suspension obtained from a non-sterile soil that led to loss of species with low cell abundance, inoculation of microcosms of the same sterile soil with these serial dilutions, and subsequent incubation to enable establishment of similar cell abundances between treatments. The structure, cell abundance and activity of denitrifying and nitrite-oxidizing communities were characterized after incubation. Increasing dilution led to a progressive decrease in community diversity as assessed by the number of denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands, while community functioning was not impaired when cell abundance recovered after incubation. The microcosms were then subjected to a model disturbance: heating to 42 degrees C for 24 h. Abundance, structure and activity of each community were measured 3 h after completion of the disturbance to assess resistance, and after incubation of microcosms for 1 month to assess resilience. Resistance and resilience to the disturbance differed between the two communities, nitrite oxidizers being more affected. However, reducing the diversity of the two microbial functional groups did not impair either their resistance or their resilience following the disturbance. These results demonstrate the low sensitivity of the resistance and resilience of both microbial groups to diversity decline provided that cell abundance is similar between treatments.","Wertz, S",2018-12-17 16:58:53.087411+00:00,199035,1,1,1,1,3,Decline of soil microbial diversity does not influence the resistance and resilience of key soil microbial functional groups following a model disturbance,,['Microbiology']

Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation.

The research questions initially focused on gathering basic information at the hotel facilities and features. But the main part of the questionnaire was related to their relationship and knowledge of environmental management systems, their criteria, their implementation and the competitive advantage sought by hotels. The results indicate that even though hoteliers have a strong sense that by using environmental management systems can improve their profit levels since the public awareness towards environmental issues is really high, more than half are not willing at adopting an environment scheme. Finally, around 2/3 of the respondents stated little or nothing can be done to conserve energy and to have extra financial benefit from an environmental scheme.","Boemi, SN",2018-12-17 17:54:06.693244+00:00,569443,1,1,1,1,3,SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT IN TOURIST FACILITIES,environmental management systems; quantitate survey; questionnaires; Greece,['Environmental Sciences']

The present study aimed to provide an inventory of the plants used by fish farmers, establishing their respective ethnobotanic importance and identifying the variables that determine the use and the choice of these plants in fish health management. A survey based on a semi-directive questionnaire was conducted using a representative sample of fish farmers (n = 504 from 176 villages) from the province of West Java. Of these fish farmers, 46% [41%, 50%; CI95%] of them use plants in their farms and 79 species of plants belonging to 36 families have been identified. Most of these plants were common plants used also traditionally in human pharmacopeia. Four categories of plant use were identified namely: improvement of water quality; reduction of fish stress; increase of fish resistance to pathogens; and treatment of fish diseases (when an outbreak occurred). In order to appraise the significance of plant usage, the following ethnobotanic parameters were determined: the Use Value (UV), the Fidelity Level (FL) and the Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). The Use Value (UV) was generally low for plants except for Carica papaya which reached the highest UV scores. The majority of the plants were used according to personal experience of the fish farmers and the knowledge related to herbal therapy appeared variable among fish farmers. Only 26 species of plants had a UV > 0.025. The highest Fidelity Level (FL) value was obtained for C. papaya. The Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) of each plant usage was relatively high for all four categories of use - ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 - but the same plant may have several therapeutic indications. The use of plants, as well as their variety and number, depended not only on fish species, production systems and production areas but also on social characteristics such as the professional experience of fish farmers and their ethnic origin. To our knowledge, this is the first ethnobotanic survey specifically applied to aquaculture. It was able to identify the species of plants used in the West Java Province, and how they are used. It also highlighted the significance of traditional Indonesian herbal therapy in aquaculture. The use of several plants in aquaculture is reported for the first time in this study.

We applied qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine how diverse members of Hawai'i's bigeye fishery community, including fishermen, a large fish auction, dealers, processors, retailers, consumers, and support industries, perceived and were affected by the constraints of the 40-day closure of the WCPO bigeye fishery at the end of 2010. Our analysis found that there was reduced supply and reduced quality of bigeye landed along with increased prices for bigeye during the closure period. In addition, Hawaii longliners were forced to travel longer distances to fish during the closure. These factors contributed to increased stress and in some cases lost revenue for a variety of individuals and businesses connected to the fishery. We also found that different stakeholder groups responded to the closure in different ways and fish dealers were among those most affected by the closure. However, overall impacts to the bigeye community were not as severe as what had been anticipated at the outset. Several mitigating factors meant this was not a true closure, as US boats could continue to fish for bigeye in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and foreign and dual permitted vessels could still fish in the WCPO. longline fleet has since benefited from US legislation and federal rules that have prevented any subsequent closures of the fishery. While this relief from closures could stall short term socioeconomic impacts to Hawaii bigeye community, some worry that it could set back global efforts towards sustainable management of the fishery.

The high rates of fuel-wood consumption are associated with fish smoking in this region and are chiefly the result of low fuel efficiency systems. In this study, we investigated the relative efficiency of two fish-smoking systems with respect to fuel wood consumption and time required for fish smoking in the DEWR. Using socio-economic and forest surveys in three villages, where mangrove wood is harvested and used, we established that the annual fuel-wood off-take was about 42,839m(3). In addition, most of the wood is used for fish smoking in the Traditional Smoke System (TSS) method, which was assessed to be 70% less efficient than the Improved Smoke System (Eeyed/CWCS). The Eeyed/CWCS consumed on average 50% less wood than the TSS, and reduced fish-smoking time by up-to 65% relative to the TSS. This comparative advantage offers opportunities for reducing the incidence of smoke-related diseases in women and children-most of them involved in the smoking process-by reducing the time spent smoking fish and saving money from avoided additional wood consumption. However, these benefits can only be achieved through the successful introduction of the Eeyed/CWCS.

In 1986, this was articulated by a policy that a ""harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction to fish habitat"" (HADD) cannot occur unless authorised with legally binding compensatory habitat to offset the HADD. Despite Canada's progressive conservation policies, the effectiveness of compensation habitat in replicating ecosystem function has never been tested on a national scale. The effectiveness of habitat compensation projects in achieving no net loss of habitat productivity (NNL) was evaluated at 16 sites across Canada. Periphyton biomass, invertebrate density, fish biomass, and riparian vegetation density were used as indicators of habitat productivity. Approximately 63% of projects resulted in net losses in habitat productivity. These projects were characterised by mean compensation ratios (area gain:area loss) of 0.7:1. Twenty-five percent of projects achieved NNL and 12% of projects achieved a net gain in habitat productivity. These projects were characterised by mean ratios of 1.1:1 and 4.8:1, respectively.

With this objective, we evaluated whether a robust network of forest connecting elements can be identified so that it remains efficient when facing different types of potential land cover changes that may affect forest habitat networks and ecological fluxes. For this purpose we considered changes both in the forested areas and in the non-forest intervening landscape matrix. We combined some of the most recent developments in graph theory with models of land cover permeability and least-cost analysis through the forest landscape. We focused on a case of study covering the habitat of a forest-dwelling bird (nuthatch, Sitta europaea) in the region of Galicia (NW Spain). Seven land-use change scenarios were analysed for their effects on connecting forest elements (patches and links): one was the simplest case in which the landscape is represented as a binary forest/non-forest pattern (and where matrix heterogeneity is disregarded), four scenarios in which forest lands were converted to other cover types (to scrubland due to wildfires, to extensive and intensive agriculture, and to urban areas), and two scenarios that only involved changes in the non-forested matrix (renaturalization and intensification). Our results show that while the network of connecting elements for the species was very robust to the conversion of the forest habitat patches to different cover types, the different change scenarios in the landscape matrix could more significantly weaken its long-term validity and effectiveness. This is particularly the case when most of the key connectivity providers for the nuthatch are located outside the protected areas or public forests in Galicia, where biodiversity-friendly measures might be more easily implemented.

Economic models indicate that cashew production is profitable at 2.8 t ha(-1) nut-in-shell (NIS). Balanced plant nutrition is essential to achieve economic yields in Australia, with nitrogen (N) of particular importance because of its capacity to modify growth, affect nut yield and Cause environmental degradation through soil acidification and off-site contamination. The study oil a commercial cashew plantation at Dimbulah, Australia, investigated the effect of N rate and timing oil cashew growth, nut production, N leaching and soil chemical properties over five growth cycles (1995-1999). Nitrogen was applied during the main periods of vegetative (December-April) and reproductive (June-October) growth. Commercial NIS yields (up to 4.4 t ha(-1) from individual trees) that exceeded the economic threshold of 2.8 t ha-1 were achieved. The yield response was mainly determined by canopy size as mean nut weight, panicle density and nuts per panicle were largely unaffected by N treatments. Nitrogen application confined to the main period of vegetative growth (December-April) produced a seasonal growth pattern that corresponded most consistently with highest NIS yield. This N timing also reduced late season flowering and Undesirable post-November nut drop. Higher yields were not produced at N rates greater than 17 g m(-2) of canopy surface area (equating to 210 kg N ha-1 for mature size trees). High yields were attained when N concentrations in Mveg leaves in May-June were about 2%, but this assessment occurs at a time when it is not feasible to correct N deficiency. The Mflor leaf of the preceding November, used in conjunction with the Mveg leaf, was proposed as a diagnostic tool to guide N rate decisions. Leaching of nitrate-N and acidification of the soil profile was recorded to 0.9 m.

In the present paper we aim at describing the extent of GPFM teaching in medical schools throughout Europe, checking for the presence of GPFM curricula and clinical teaching in GP offices. Methods: A brief questionnaire was e-mailed to GPFM or other professors at European medical universities. Results: 259 out of 400 existing universities in 39 European countries responded to our questionnaire. Out of these, 35 (13.5%) reported to have no GPFM curriculum. These 35 medical faculties were located in 12 different European countries. In addition, 15 of the medical schools where a GPFM curriculum did exist, reported that this curriculum did not include any clinical component (n = 5), or that the clinical part of the course was very brief - less than one week, mostly only a few hours (n = 10). In total, 50 universities (19%) thus had no or a very brief GPFM curriculum. These were mainly located in the Eastern or Southern European regions. Conclusion: It is still possible to graduate from European medical universities without having been exposed to a GPFM curriculum. The European Academy of Teachers in General Practice (EURACT) will launch efforts to change this situation.","Brekke, M",2018-12-17 16:41:52.489676+00:00,66059,2,1,2,2,3,Undergraduate medical education in general practice/family medicine throughout Europe - a descriptive study,General practice/family medicine; Medical education; Undergraduate; Clinical curriculum; Europe,"['Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines']"

Research and operational experience show that total plantation biomass productivity exceeding 22.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) green weight basis with rotations less than 25 years are biologically possible, financially attractive, and environmentally sustainable. These gains become possible when intensively managed forest plantations are treated as agro-ecosystems where both the crop trees and the soil are managed to optimize productivity and value. Intensive management of southern US pine plantations could significantly increase the amount of biomass available to supply bioenergy firms. Results from growth and yield simulations using models and a financial analysis suggest that if the 130 000 km(2) of cutover pine plantations and an additional 20 000 km(2) of planted idle farmland are intensively managed in the most profitable regimes, up to 77.5 Tg green weight basis of woody biomass could be produced annually. However, questions exist about the extent to which intensive management for biomass production can improve financial returns to owners and whether they would adopt these systems. The financial analysis suggests providing biomass for energy from pine plantations on cutover sites is most profitable when intensive management is used to produce a mixture of traditional forest products and biomass for energy. Returns from dedicated biomass plantations on cutover sites and idle farmland will be lower than integrated product plantations unless prices for biomass increase or subsidies are available.

These non-cropped habitats are primarily made up of trees, hedgerows and grassy margins and their amount, quality and spatial configuration can have strong implications for the delivery and sustainability of various ecosystem services. In this study high spatial resolution (0.5 m) colour infrared aerial photography (CIR) was used in object based image analysis for the classification of non-cropped habitat in a 10,029 ha area of southeast England. Three classification scenarios were devised using 4 and 9 class scenarios. The machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) was used to reduce the number of variables used for each classification scenario by 25.5 % +/- 2.7%. Proportion of votes from the 4 class hierarchy was made available to the 9 class scenarios and where the highest ranked variables in all cases. This approach allowed for misclassified parent objects to be correctly classified at a lower level. A single object hierarchy with 4 class proportion of votes produced the best result (kappa 0.909). Validation of the optimum training sample size in RF showed no significant difference between mean internal out-of-bag error and external validation. As an example of the utility of this data, we assessed habitat suitability for a declining farmland bird, the yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella), which requires hedgerows associated with grassy margins. We found that similar to 22% of hedgerows were within 200 m of margins with an area >183.31 m(2).

We estimated the species composition for ants, the number of species and equitability for ants and plants, and the plant coverage at each site. Of these indices, percentage of plant cover showed the most rapid return to pre-disturbance values. In a few cases, full return occurred after around 25 years in both savanna and forest. A multiple factorial analysis of ant composition showed that species structure in old recovered sites converged sometimes, but not always, to that in surrounding natural habitats. Therefore, ant diversity may be used to monitor ecosystem recovery. However, even small scale human intervention may have irreversible effects on tropical habitats.

Through CBM initiatives, Arctic residents conduct or are involved in ongoing observing and monitoring activities. Arctic Indigenous peoples have been observing the environment for millennia, and CBM often incorporates traditional knowledge, which may be used independently from or in partnership with conventional scientific monitoring methods. Drawing on insights from the first Arctic Observing Summit, we provide an overview of the state of CBM in the Arctic. The CBM approach to monitoring is centered on community needs and interests. It offers fine-grained, local-scale data that are readily accessible to community and municipal decision makers. In spite of these advantages, CBM initiatives remain little documented and are often unconnected to wider networks, with the result that many practitioners lack a clear sense of the field and how best to support its growth and development. CBM initiatives are implemented within legal and governance frameworks that vary significantly both within and among different national contexts. Further documentation of differences and similarities among Arctic communities in relation to observing needs, interests, and legal and institutional capacities will help assess how CBM can contribute to Arctic observing networks. While CBM holds significant potential to meet observing needs of communities, more investment and experimentation are needed to determine how observations and data generated through CBM approaches might effectively inform decision making beyond the community level.","Johnson, N",2018-12-17 17:58:36.415819+00:00,631755,1,1,1,2,3,The Contributions of Community-Based Monitoring and Traditional Knowledge to Arctic Observing Networks: Reflections on the State of the Field,community-based monitoring; traditional knowledge; observing networks; environmental change; sustainability; knowledge management; natural resource management,"['Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical']"

The aim of this paper is to reveal the impact of different logging techniques on forest composition, sustainability and logged biomass. We performed simulations both with and without damage to trees due to harvesting. The latter simulations allowed us to deduce that an optimum logging cycle of 100 years maximizes yield. In contrast, short logging cycles of 20 years show low yields and dramatic changes in the species composition of the forest. To restore the species composition to its undisturbed state, a regeneration time of 200 years is needed.

Under zero grazing, percentage total vegetation cover was significantly (P < 0.05) less than under light, medium, and heavy grazing. Although not dominant in any treatments, percentage cover of Carex duriuscula (Cyperaceae) was higher than other species in the zero, light, and medium grazed treatments. Its cover tended to decline as grazing intensity increased (P = 0.49). Aneurolepidium chinense (Poaceae) reasserted its dominant status in the zero grazed grassland; A. frigida remained dominant under light and medium grazing. Under heavy grazing, Potentilla acaulis (Rosaceae) was the dominant species and it provided the highest percentage cover. Zero and heavy grazing resulted in fewer (three-four) species contributing most of the total cover (cf. six seven species for light and medium grazing). This was reflected by indices of diversity and evenness, which were highest for light and medium grazing. The Simpson Dominance Index was highest for the zero and heavily grazed treatments, indicating that at the extremes of the grazing spectrum, single species tended to exclude potential co-dominants more effectively than at intermediate levels of grazing. Selective grazing was a key process. Grazing increased the proportion of unpalatable and grazing resistant species, and species that although palatable, were relatively inconspicuous.

Timely access to accurate CD4 results is crucial at the primary level of the health system. For the past 7 years, the Institute of Human Virology of the University of Maryland School of Medicine has implemented a flexible and sustainable three-phase model: (1) site assessment and improvement, (2) appropriate technology selection with capacity building through practical training and laboratory mentoring, and (3) quality management system strengthening and monitoring, to support accessibility to reliable CD4 counting at the point of service. CD4 testing capacity was established in 122 of 229 (53%) laboratories supported in Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Among those in rural settings, 46% (69/151) had CD4 testing available at site level, with a functioning flow cytometer installed at 28% (8/29) and 50% (61/122) of level 1 and level 2 sites, respectively.

Interestingly, we find that uniform pricing induced by consumers' concerns of fairness can actually help mitigate price competition and hence increase firms' profits if the demand of the product category is expandable. Furthermore, an individual firm may not have an incentive to unilaterally mitigate consumers' concerns of price fairness to its own branded variants, which suggests the long-run sustainability of the uniform pricing strategy. As a result, fairness concerns from consumers provide a natural mechanism for firms to commit to uniform pricing and enhance their profits.","Chen, YX",2018-12-17 17:44:06.022070+00:00,545612,2,2,2,2,3,The Benefit of Uniform Price for Branded Variants,pricing; peer-induced fairness; price fairness; behavioral economics,['Business']

The study not only captures the perspectives of both multinational buyers and their emerging market suppliers, but also provides supplementary evidence from other key stakeholders, such as NGOs and unions.

Plant diseases caused by fungi or bacteria, such as clubroot, yellows are major problems. To address these problems, crop rotation with sweet corn, introduction of resistant radish varieties as trap crops or inoculation with endophytes have been applied. Injury caused by nematodes is also a serious problem. Practical methods using antagonistic plants such as marigold have been developed, because only one season is required to introduce these plants with only minor changes in the cropping systems. Selection of crop combinations is essential. Tare (Colocasia esculenta Schott.) is severely damaged by a root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus coffeae). By examining the degree of suppression of this nematode by many kinds of crops, determination of crop sequence efficiency became possible for the control of nematodes and offers a wider range of selection of crop combinations. Tare is injured by P. coffeae and by the root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita), while radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is attacked by the root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans).

This review considers the accumulated knowledge on the environmental effects of aquaculture in Chilean coastal areas, analyses the capacity of the industry to treat its waste and also gives some insight into new culture technologies and strategies that are currently under research and discussion in Chile. Data relating to the environmental impact of aquaculture in Chile are scarce and much is subject to severe methodological restrictions with regard to sampling design. Results related to the environmental effects show that seaweed cultivation can have an impact on sedimentation processes, increase of invertebrate assemblages and algal epiphytic abundances It has also been ascertained that mollusc farming causes biodeposition, faunal changes and possible effects related to the introduction of new species, as well as pathogens and other unforeseen species. It has been affirmed that fish cultivation, in particular that of salmon species, also has an environmental impact related to organic sedimentation and changes in the fauna. However these results indicate that, in general, the current dynamics of bays and fjords seem to be an important factor for the environmental sustainability of the salmon culture areas. Salmon cultivation has also been associated with phytoplankton blooms, but this point was not supported by a monitoring programme in southern Chile. Furthermore, there is concern related to new pathogen introduction and therapeutical applications to the fish cultures, and further research is required in this field. Regulations to protect the environment from the consequences of aquaculture activities have been adopted during the last couple of years. The main regulations are provided by international market standards. Nevertheless, these regulations can only be effective if other human activities, such as urban discharge, intensive agriculture fertilisation and pesticide utilisation, are taken into consideration, in an integrated perspective. On the other hand, the Chilean salmon farming industry in particular, would be in a position to cover the costs involved in the treatment of waste waters, if feeding management were improved in the future.

The important increasing loss of species emphasizes the ecological significance of elucidating the effects of environmental stressors, such as pesticides, on reproduction. Despite its special reproductive behavior, the honey bee was selected as a relevant and integrative environmental model because of its constant and diverse exposure to many stressors due to foraging activity. The widely used insecticide Fipronil, the use of which is controversial because of its adverse effects on honey bees, was chosen to expose captive drones in hives via syrup contaminated at 0.1 mu g/L and gathered by foragers. Such environmental exposure led to decreased spermatozoa concentration and sperm viability coupled with an increased sperm metabolic rate, resulting in drone fertility impairment. Subsequently, unexposed queens inseminated with such sperm exhibited fewer spermatozoa with lower viability in their spermatheca, leaving no doubt about the detrimental consequences for the reproductive potential of queens, which are key for colony sustainability. These findings suggest that pesticides could contribute to declining honey bee populations through fertility impairment, as exemplified by Fipronil.

Spores were incorporated in poly(ethylene terephthalate, 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol) (PETG), an amorphous PET copolymer having a considerable lower processing temperature and higher moisture absorption compared to PET. To asses spore viability after incorporation, a method was optimized to extract spores from PETG using a chloroform/water mixture.

This set of concerns is coupled with declines in some fish stocks due to mismanagement, such as overfishing, failure to account for bycatch, or gear damage to habitats, and/or changing environmental conditions. At the same time, there are examples of management decisions and habitat restoration efforts that have led to the recovery of depleted stocks and habitats. All of this is happening in the context of new concerns about marine biodiversity, marine reserves, and application of the Endangered Species Act to marine species (e.g., salmonids with extensive riverine, and ocean habitat needs). The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA), passed by Congress in September 1996, and signed by President Clinton 11 October 1996, is a wake-up call that mandates, as federal policy, that fishery management move toward better incorporation of information on fish habitats and use of ecosystem approaches in management decisions. Currently, fishery managers in the National Marine Fisheries Service and the eight regional councils are in the process of adapting to these new directions. Habitat-oriented and ecosystem-based approaches offer potential solutions to some of the management problems, but they are not panaceas. Ecosystem approaches carry institutional requirements that demand major changes in research and training and require support from the user communities and the public. Ecologically sustainable fisheries are undoubtedly much different fisheries from many of those now observed. Actions to implement the SFA portend significant progress toward more sustainable fisheries and healthier ecosystems. However, major gaps exist in understanding how to manage the transition from current fishery practices to ecologically sustainable ones, and significant increases in human and fiscal resources are necessary to overcome these gaps.","Fluharty, D",2018-12-17 17:27:45.779409+00:00,408947,1,1,1,1,3,"Habitat protection, ecological issues, and implementation of the Sustainable Fisheries Act","essential fish habitat (EFH); fisheries, habitat, and pollution; fishery management, ecosystem-based; fishery quotas; habitat protection; Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSFCMA); marine biodiversity; National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); optimum yield; overfishing; Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA)",['Ecology; Environmental Sciences']

Components of the agricultural production chain are analysed using environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) and a financial value attributed to the resources consumed and burden imposed on the environment by agriculture, as well as to the products. The sum of the Outputs is weighed against the inputs and the system considered sustainable if the value of the outputs exceeds those of the inputs. If this ratio is plotted against the sum of inputs for all levels of input, a diminishing returns curve should result and the optimum level of sustainability is located at the maximum of the curve. Data were taken from standard economic almanacs and from published LCA reports on the extent of consumption and environmental burdens resulting from firming in the UK. Land-use is Valued using the concept of ecosystem services. Our analysis suggests that agricultural systems ire sustainable at rates of production close to current levels practiced in the UK. Extensification of farming, which is thought to favour non-food ecosystem services, requires more land to produce the same amount of food. The loss of ecosystem services hitherto provided by natural land brought into production is greater than that which can be provided by land now under extensive farming. This loss of ecosystem service is large in comparison to the benefit of a reduction in emission of nutrients and pesticides. However, food production is essential, so the coupling of subsidies that represent a relatively large component of the economic output in EU farming, with measures to reduce pollution are well-aimed. Measures to ensure that as little extra land is brought into production as possible or that marginal land is allowed to revert to nature would seem to be equally well-aimed, even if this required more intensive use of productive areas. We conclude that current arable farming in the EU is sustainable with either realistic prices for products or some degree of subsidy and that productivity per unit area of land and greenhouse gas emission (subsuming primary energy consumption) are the most important pressures on the sustainability of farming.

On the other hand, this fishery has positive externalities on the economy of the local community and interestingly enough on a protected seabird species in the area (the Frigatebird that feeds on discards).

Although the direct and indirect environmental impacts of commercial logging may be significant, particularly for a few specific regions and countries, this is generally not thought to be the predominant cause of tropical deforestation. Other factors, in particular conversion of forest land for agricultural use and harvesting of trees for fuelwood, are considered to be much more important in the process of tropical deforestation. A review of statistical analyses of the causes of deforestation provides only limited evidence of the linkages between tropical timber production, trade and deforestation. However, the timber trade can lead to greater net returns for forestry investments and sustainable management of production forests, making this option more attractive than converting forest land to alternative uses. Therefore, an important factor in reducing timber-related tropical deforestation is ensuring proper economic incentives for efficient and sustainable management of tropical production forests. Appropriate forest management policies and regulations within producer countries ought to provide these incentives so that the long run income-generating potential of harvesting timber is maximized, and any significant external environmental costs associated with timber harvesting are internalized.","BURGESS, JC",2018-12-17 17:28:09.154151+00:00,417626,1,1,1,1,3,"TIMBER PRODUCTION, TIMBER TRADE AND TROPICAL DEFORESTATION",,"['Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences']"

Data collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service can be used to directly address at least 11 biological indicators. The FIA program has conducted periodic inventories of forestland for several decades. These inventories provide statistical estimates of forest area, timber volume, growth, removals, and mortality Recent legislation has mandated that the Forest Service inventory the forestland of the US on an annual basis measuring the entire set of national sample plots over a 5-year period. This paper identifies which criteria and indicators can be addressed by FIA data; the scale at which it may be appropriate to use these data; and how recent changes will impact the Forest Service's ability to provide information needed to address these indicators. Data from the two most recent inventories of Iowa (1974 and 1990) and Minnesota (1977 and 1990) are used to show how criteria and indicators relate to trends in forest composition and extent, timber resource utilization, and the population size of native and non-native trees. These two states have distinctly different forest resources, ranging from sparse to dense, and provide a good test of the effectiveness of using forest inventory data to provide criteria and indicator information at the state level. Analysis of the data for the last two inventories of Iowa and Minnesota reveals that the area of timberland has increased by 34 and 8%, respectively, while growing-stock volumes have increased by 47 and 23%.

Parallel EBV genomes led to relatively stable copies in different 293 sublineages, suggesting the viral genome structure is a factor for the sustainability of EBV's copy number. Moreover, the LMP1 transcription in high copy-containing cells showed abnormally high level. Furthermore, the main LMP1-driven pathway, transcription factor NF-kappa B, was highly activated in high-copy cells. Here we first manifest by experimental model that the copy number of EBV latent genome correlates with the viral pathogenesis, which depends on the activation level of LMP1 and NF-kappa B. Overall, both the presence and amount of EBV genome are crucial for the viral oncogenicity.","Zuo, LL",2018-12-17 17:43:13.397273+00:00,497161,2,2,2,2,3,The copy number of Epstein-Barr virus latent genome correlates with the oncogenicity by the activation level of LMP1 and NF-kappa B,Epstein-Barr virus; latent genome; copy number; latent membrane protein 1; oncogenicity,['Oncology; Cell Biology']

However, a disproportionate amount of all environmental impact comes today from consumption and everyday life, particularly in how purchased products are put to use by concrete individuals in their daily lives. Such daily practices, moreover, are always deeply embedded in historical, cultural, and social specificities. Thus, we suggest, alongside other scholars, that sustainability studies should also consider routinized domestic practices. In this article, we do so by examining some everyday habits linked to eating, personal hygiene, and cleaning in Brazil, as well as discourses that are currently developing around sustainability in this country. We contrast the two and show that, oftentimes, individuals' awareness about sustainability is at odds with their own consumption practices. Based on qualitative and quantitative research, we investigate (1) routinized, potentially environmentally-unsustainable practices of washing, cleaning, and eating in Brazil, and (2) Brazilian consumers' perceptions about sustainability, ultimately suggesting that both perceptions and practices are indicating substantial impediments to a more sustainable way of life.

The aim of this paper is first to analyze a well-studied human dominated agroecosystem using five existing key heuristics of the resilience perspective and second to discuss the consequences of using this resilience perspective for the future management of similar human dominated agroecosystems. The human dominated agroecosystem is located in the Dutch Northern Frisian Woodlands where cooperatives of dairy farmers have been attempting to organize a transition toward more viable and environmental friendly agrosystems. A mobilizing element in the cooperatives was the ability of some dairy farmers to obtain high herbage and milk yield production with limited nitrogen fertilizer input. A set of reinforcing measures was hypothesized to rebalance nitrogen flows and to set a new equilibrium. A dynamic farm model was used to evaluate the long-term effects of reinforcing measures on soil organic matter content, which was considered the key indicator of an alternative system state. Simulations show that no alternative stable state for soil organic matter exists within a plausible range of fertilizer applications. The observed differences in soil organic matter content and nutrient use efficiency probably represent a time lag of long-term nonequilibrium system development. The resilience perspective proved to be especially insightful in addressing interacting long-term developments expressed in the panarchy. Panarchy created a heterogeneity of resources in the landscape providing local landscape-embedded opportunities for high N-efficiencies. Stopping the practice of grassland renewal will allow this ecological landscape embedded system to mature. In contrast, modern conventional dairy farms shortcut the adaptive cycle by frequent grassland renewals, resulting in high resilience and adaptability. This comes at the cost of long-term accumulated ecological capital of soil organic matter and transformability, thus reinforcing the incremental adaptation trap. Analysis of such a human dominated agroecosystem reveals that rather than alternative states, an alternative set of relationships within a multiscale setting applies, indicating the importance for embedding panarchy in the analysis of sustainable development goals in agroecosystems.","van Apeldoorn, DF",2018-12-17 16:56:17.777890+00:00,186944,1,1,1,1,3,"Panarchy Rules: Rethinking Resilience of Agroecosystems, Evidence from Dutch Dairy-Farming",agroecosystems; dairy farming; panarchy; Northern Frisian Woodlands; The Netherlands; resilience; soil organic matter,['Ecology; Environmental Studies']

However, momentous and when it comes to sustainability rather deleterious is evolving in the past five years or so: automobiles have flooded the city along with car-friendly policies being promulgated at both the central and local levels of government. Consequently, the market share of public transport has been substantially eroded since then. Apart from the rapid motorization that weakened Dalian's position as a green city, another factor fueling the downward trend of transit attractiveness has been the growing fragmentation in transit services. Given the fact that the motorization process is irreversible and restricting car purchase and use is unlikely to work out in China, if something needs to be done to maintain Dalian as a clean and comfortable living habitat, then lifting the fragmentation in the transit system is the only way to do this. Therefore, this paper explores where the fragmentation originates, and how it can be counteracted. A mathematical model is thus built to test the effectiveness of reducing fragmentation in improving transit service. And the results show that the modal split after system integration is going to tilt more strongly towards transit, while for service quality levels for users cannot expect much improvement.

We investigate the remnants of natural Tugai vegetation along the middle reaches of the Tarim River, where we still can find natural river dynamics. We follow the hypothesis that the groundwater depth and the salinization of the groundwater are the major factors, which influence the differentiation of the plant communities. The most frequent species in the I I plant communities of the Tugai vegetation in the Tarim River floodplain are Populus euphratica, Tamarix ramosissima, and Phragmites australis. Most of the plant communities are located not more than I kill away, from the river courses or lakes and oil sites with a groundwater level not deeper than 4 m. With increasing groundwater depth, the mean species numbers decreases. Recruitment Of most of the species is limited to sites, which are flooded or inundated, respectively. Due to river course changes in the past decades, sites change from flooded to dry with groundwater levels deeper than 10 m and increasing soil salt content. Based on information oil the spatial distribution of the plant communities and the river dynamics ill the past decades, a Succession scheme is worked out. During succession, which is driven by river dynamics, more and more species disappear according to their ability to grow deep roots in order to maintain groundwater contact and their ability, to withstand increasing salt contents.","Thevs, N",2018-12-17 17:06:29.833381+00:00,263428,1,1,1,1,3,"Vegetation and vegetation dynamics in the Tarim River floodplain of continental-arid Xinjiang, NW China",desert ecosystems; groundwater; Populus euphratica; Tugai vegetation; vegetation dynamics,['Plant Sciences; Ecology']

In West Bengal, the majority of registered cases are from the district of Nadia, and the maximum number of deaths due to arsenicosis is from the district of South 24 Paraganas. The reason behind the problem in India is thought to be mainly geogenic, though there are instances of reported anthropogenic contamination of arsenic from industrial sources. The reason for leaching of arsenic in ground water is attributed to various factors, including excessive withdrawal of ground water for the purpose of irrigation, use of bio-control agents and phosphate fertilizers. It remains a mystery why all those who are exposed to arsenic-contaminated water do not develop the full-blown disease. Various host factors, such as nutritional status, socioeconomic status, and genetic polymorphism, are thought to make a person vulnerable to the disease. The approach to arsenicosis mitigation needs be holistic, sustainable, and multidisciplinary, with the 2 main pillars being health education and provision of arsenic-free water.

187,WOS:000305306700015,"d'Oro, EC, Golay, MW","The Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR), among Generation IV reactor concepts, has promising features such as its feasibility, scalability, and sustainability. However, despite these compelling technical attributes, the SFR design carries some less-desirable features, when considered from a nonproliferation perspective. In case of large-scale adoption, the SFR would inject into the global system an additional amount of special nuclear materials (SNMs), mostly plutonium, that, depending on some design choices such as the adoption of fuel blankets, would increase overall proliferation risks. In addition, the SFR is very often envisioned as, and in some cases relies upon, having its own fuel cycle. Most of the proposed SFR designs today come with a colocated reprocessing facility and a fabrication facility. The introduction of new facilities and the circulation of SNMs in forms and morphologies different from a traditional fuel assembly will also contribute to the increase of the overall proliferation risk. The worldwide experience available for this technology suggests that its economic feasibility is related to different metrics such as plant operational availability, safety, and nonproliferation performance. To obtain good outcomes concerning this multigoal objective, a metric expressing the nonproliferation performance for the SFR energy system performance needs to be defined and to be related to other performance metrics. This paper describes our efforts toward this multigoal objective. We focus on design metrics for evaluation of the proliferation risks introduced by the SFR as well as the models, tools, and ultimately the design criteria that would be required in order to assess the proliferation risk. We follow the paradigm of nuclear safety and replicate the methods and the approaches used for risk-informing nuclear designs from a safety standpoint. The paper describes the characteristics required by a risk-informed framework for proliferation evaluation, the model used to conduct the assessment of the SFR, and an overview of the features that designers and regulators would need to relate proliferation performance metrics to cost and safety metrics. A novel nonproliferation metric is proposed and described through a competition model between two actors: the energy system's safeguarder and a potential proliferator interested in acquiring SNMs. The method developed is analogous to that of plant reliability fault tress in that it includes the creation of an event and success tree models that start from basic events and lead to the top metric, measuring the proliferation performance. The method allows measuring the proliferation performance by means of a metric expressing the proliferator's success probability in acquiring SNMs. However, measuring the likelihood of a scenario is not enough if not coupled with the assessment of the consequences associated with its realization. For this, a new probability-consequences (P-C) curve is proposed for use in regulating the nonproliferation scenarios dealing with acquisition of SNMs. The addition of new design options such as detection devices and of degraded materials as means to reduce the opportunities attracting a proliferator to divert the SNM are used as illustrative applications of the new framework. The examples use a reference design based on preliminarily proposed designs. Then the framework is implemented using security and safety criteria in a fashion consistent with recently proposed U.S. regulations, which are risk informed and performance based. This proposed framework demonstrates a method for the quantification of proliferation risks and shows how it can be integrated with other design considerations. Ultimately, the framework proposed is a first step toward strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency's current ability to protect nuclear energy systems from proliferation risks.","d'Oro, EC",2019-01-08 08:39:47.069864+00:00,245724,2,2,1,2,3,INFORMING NUCLEAR ENERGY SYSTEMS WITH PROLIFERATION RISK,proliferation; risk assessment; risk acceptance,['Nuclear Science & Technology']

Potentially biodegradable plastic films (bioplastics) and fabrics (biofabrics) can be made from renewable materials, are compostable, and may degrade in the soil after the growing season, but there are questions about the field performance of these products. A two-year study was conducted in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) across two climatically diverse locations in Illinois, USA to compare performance among two bioplastic films (Eco Film and Bio Telo) and four experimental spunbond, nonwoven biofabrics (3M Company). Soil temperature and moisture, mulch durability and deterioration, weed suppression, and crop yield data were collected throughout each growing season. Bioplastic films began deteriorating as early as 3-5 weeks after transplanting crops, which contributed to increased weed emergence and evaporative soil water loss. In contrast, the BK-1-270 biofabric mulch did not deteriorate during the growing season, increased soil moisture throughout the season by up to 3.0% relative to bare soil, and eliminated weed competition. Bioplastic films increased soil temperatures by as much as 1.7 degrees C in northern Illinois and 2.3 degrees C in central Illinois, whereas soil temperatures were not different between bare soil and biofabrics. Increased soil temperature can hasten crop development and increase yield in cooler climates, but can also contribute to physiological stress and root disease in warmer climates. Biofabric and bioplastic mulches did not increase tomato or pepper fruit yields relative to bare soil.

This research tests the effect of barley straw mulching on soil erosion and surface runoff on vineyards in Eastern Spain where the soil and water losses are non-sustainable. An experiment was setup using rainfall simulation tests at 55 mm h(-1) over 1 h on forty paired plots of 0.24m(2): twenty bare and twenty straw covered. Straw cover varied from 48 to 90% with a median value of 59% as a result of the application of 75 g of straw per m(2).

Sustainable urban planning of high-density cities from the urban climatic point of view is a topical issue for city planners and policy makers. However, the application of urban climatic knowledge has only led to low-impact urban planning decision-making. This is especially true in high-density cities in developing countries. Thus, there is an urgent need to seek ways to quickly collate urban climatic information for planning in a format that is user-friendly for planners. This study has identified ways to promote the use of urban climatic knowledge in planning. By utilizing readily-available data, the paper introduces a method that focuses on urban planning using an urban climatic map (UCMap). A UCMap provides a visual and spatial information platform for the planner-friendly Geographical Information System (GIS). By focusing on Kaohsiung, Taiwan, the study first defines the urban climatic issues in the area. It then introduces the key methodology of urban climatic mapping and elaborates on general urban-climatic-based planning advice for planners using a UCMap. Lastly, it identifies sensitive areas and provides planning recommendations that can be easily tested and applied by city planners. The critical importance of urban greenery and coverage, urban air paths and open spaces, water bodies and rivers, and building morphology and layout have been highlighted visually and spatially for planners.

We then compared the percentage of each ecoregion and plant-cover type in each land protection class. We assumed that 12% protection represents an acceptable minimum and examined the percentage of site records of rare plants in protected and unprotected areas. Of 28 ecoregions in Alaska, 15 (63.4%) have <12% of their area in highly protected areas. Similarly, 11 of 21 vegetation-cover types (43.7%) have <12% protection. For 32 rare vascular plants, an average of 27% of records occur on highly protected lands. Seventy-five percent of the rare plants had <50% of their records from highly protected lands. Less than 1% of Alaska has been permanently altered by human activity. In contrast to the lower 48 states, times remains to plan development that preserves biodiversity while permitting an economically sustainable economy-if the effort is made now.","Duffy, DC",2018-12-17 16:56:06.738866+00:00,186091,1,1,1,2,3,Landscape assessment of the degree of protection of Alaska's terrestrial biodiversity,,['Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences']

We analyzed the methods used by 95 organizations, experienced in sustainability reporting. We used both quantitative and qualitative data extracted from the integrated reports published in 2014. The theoretical framework of the research relies on the stakeholder theory. The perspective used in the analysis of the results was derived from the classic and modern theories in marketing, which include the use of annual reports as marketing communication tools. The main results show that the provisions of the International Integrated Reporting Framework were only partially observed by the organizations included in the sample. The analyzed reporting practices show evidence of the existence of correlations between the size of integrated reports and the disclosure of the value added distribution for the traditional stakeholders. The disclosure of information regarding the customers, environment and the society is correlated with the presentation of the value added statement.","Dumitru, M",2018-12-17 17:59:44.434704+00:00,651627,1,1,1,1,3,MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS OF VALUE CREATION IN SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATIONS.

Rather unique for the cross-border region of Croatian and Serbia the process was initiated within the EU project RoK-FOR [1] and based on a 'triple helix' principle- taking into consideration perspectives of science, administration and stakeholders [2 in 3]. Achieved body of information provides insights into forest-related issues in the context of renewable energy in the Western Balkans. Materials and methods: The methods and analytical frame used for the purpose of this article was proposed by [3], focusing on: actors and their roles in the process; instruments and tools used in the process of gathering information and consultation; and assessing the level of interaction among actors during the consultation processes. Stakeholders' panel was the main instrument that generated ""body of information"", whereas structured interviews were used for better understanding of actors involved. For understanding administrative and legislative framework the whole set of documents and decisions from both countries was analysed while observational notes helped to critically reflect upon data obtained by stakeholder interviews. Results and conclusions: Use of stakeholders' panel as a platform for creating a rather robust ""body of information"" proved to be valuable tool in the consultation processes, which resulted in a consensus of participating actors on strategic research topics and common recognition of major challenges related to forest biomass production and use. An overall level of interaction among participants can in both countries be classified as of a ""medium intensity"", although the ways of interaction were somewhat different. The results could serve as inputs to national research and/or energy strategies in context of achieving renewable energy goals and fulfilment of obligations according to the Kyoto Protocol.","Stevanov, M",2018-12-17 18:03:57.478014+00:00,684527,1,1,1,1,3,Consultation process on forest biomass and sustainable forest management: How knowledge mobilization in the cross-border region of Croatia and Serbia worked?,consultation process; forest biomass; sustanable forest management; regional research agenda; ROK-FOR,['Biology']
199,WOS:000283582300003,"de Dreu, CKW","In intergroup conflict, individual cooperation may be directed at strengthening the ingroup, thus undermining the effectiveness and sustainability of the competing outgroup. Reversely, cooperation directed towards the competing outgroup indirectly undermines the viability of the ingroup and is often seen by ingroup members as disloyal, non-cooperative behavior. Using the Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma-Maximizing Differences Game to model intergroup conflict, the experiment reported here shows that compared to individuals with a chronic pro-self orientation, those with a chronic pro-social orientation display stronger ingroup trust and ingroup love-they self-sacrifice to benefit their ingroup-but not more or less outgroup distrust and outgroup hate. Furthermore, in this situation pro-social individuals were driven more by ingroup fairness considerations when contributing to their ingroup. Path analyses suggest that effects of social value orientation on ingroup love are mediated by ingroup trust and not by fairness considerations. Implications for research on social value orientations, and intergroup conflict and competition are discussed.","de Dreu, CKW",2018-12-17 17:33:20.920824+00:00,459424,2,2,2,2,3,Social value orientation moderates ingroup love but not outgroup hate in competitive intergroup conflict,cooperation; intergroup conflict; fairness; social values; trust,"['Psychology, Social']"
